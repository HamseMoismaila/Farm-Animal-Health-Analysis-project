# 🐄🐓 **Farm Animal Health Analysis** 🐖🐑  

### 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project explores farm animal health using data analysis techniques to identify patterns in **weight, age, and health status**. By leveraging data, we aim to **detect potential health risks** earlier and provide insights that could help in better livestock management.  

---

## 📊 **Key Findings**  
✔ **Healthy animals tend to be slightly older and heavier**.  
✔ **Weak negative correlation (-0.032) between weight and age** – further investigation needed.  
✔ **Horses & Ducks were the most common animals in the dataset**.

## 🔬 **Project Breakdown**  

### 1️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- Checked for **missing values** (None found ✅).  
- Removed **outliers** for accurate trend analysis.  
- Standardized weight and age values for consistency.  

### 2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Distribution of weight & age** across different animal types.  
- **Health status trends** based on weight & age.  
- **Correlation analysis** between key features.  

### 3️⃣ **Next Steps** 🚀  
🔹 **Developing an ML Model** – Predicting animal health based on key features.  
🔹 **Exploring additional factors** – Diet, environment, and breed-specific risks.
